# Purpose: 	A regression testing suite against the Test instance of Discovery
#		At one time, all of these strings caused "500 Internal Server Error"-style crashes
#		Some were due to the Zero Results bug
#		Some were due to a bug in handling punctuation
#		These were inspired by early revisions of mobyTest.pl, which found these class of errors!
