# Purpose: 	A regression test, validating that we have an appropriate amount of data in the SolrCloud index.
#		On this day, rapidly deployed a release & slammed it all the way into Production, only to discover
#		that the "eBooks and more" bento-pane was permanently empty. ARGH!
#		This was due to a bug, and rapidly fixed, but indicates a lack of testing - it could easily have been
#		spotted in Test, if we had bothered to look.
# RevisionCntl: github, ualbertalib/discovery
# Context: 	the blacklight/discovery project
# Ideas for improvement:
# 		needs to read *all* the bento-panes
