# Purpose:	This Log File Adapter is designed to be hooked into a textual, appending-style log file.
# 		You tell it where to start processing, and then later you ask it whether it saw any bad things.
# Note: 	If you're using this, it like means you can multiplex & run the tests concurrently - if two
# 		tests were watching one log file simultaneously, and one causes a new line to be written to
# 		the log, BOTH tests would see the new entry.  That would be bad!
# Note: 	This is desgned to be an abstract class! You never instantiate an LFA object. Write new
# 		code to make an LFA for a specific log file, see Catalina.pm
