Description:
    Replaces maps used by the ingest process.  In particular these provide the human readable string for locations
    and institutions based on the latest values in the application database.

Example:
    rails generate solr_marc_prep

    This will replace:
        config/SolrMarc/index_scripts/institution.bsh
        config/SolrMarc/index_scripts/location_facet.bsh
