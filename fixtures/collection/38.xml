<dc:description>Explore Aboriginal origin and settlement patterns across Canada with a focus on Alberta. Stories of Aboriginal origin and settlement are central themes and provide students with a wealth of text, images, audio (including oral histories) and video resources. An examination of specific Aboriginal communities - including the Cree, Dene, Beaver, Métis and Blackfoot - traces the evolution of Aboriginal Peoples from nomadic tribes to dynamic communities settled across the province.</dc:description>
